"Ranged weaponry, as thought up by Steve."

A description of the mod's details can be found here -> https://wildwestscifi.net/coding/9889-and-then-i-did-some-minecraft-modding 

This is my fork of Quiverbow, which I'm using to cleanup and later port the mod. This version of Quiverbow is NOT official, and any issues should be reported to me rather than Domochevsky. I have no idea how long the cleanup and port will take, but I'm chipping away at it bit by bit.
